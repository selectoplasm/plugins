# Selectoplasm Development Plugins

This repo is a collection of the plugins that were made during the development of Selectoplasm. They're not really meant for public use since they're more about testing out various features, but they do make for good examples of how to create plugins.

Selectoplasm is designed to make it very easy for anyone to make their own plugins. You can get started as easily as adding some utility classes to a css file, and then get progressively more sophisticated.

Check out the [Creating Plugins Documentation](https://www.selectoplasm.com/docs/plugins/Overview) for more information.
